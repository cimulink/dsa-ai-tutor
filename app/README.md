This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Features

- Interactive DSA problem browser
- Monaco code editor for JavaScript development
- AI-powered tutoring with OpenRouter integration
- Test case execution and results visualization
- Responsive 3-column layout (Problem | Code Editor | AI Chat)

## AI Integration

The app integrates with OpenRouter to provide AI tutoring capabilities:

1. Users can configure their OpenRouter API key in the Settings page
2. Multiple AI models are supported (free and paid options)
3. The AI tutor provides explanations, hints, and code reviews
4. All API keys are stored locally in the browser

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with your OpenRouter API key for server-side proxy (optional):

```
